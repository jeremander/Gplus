 DESCRIPTION
=============

This program is an implementation of affinity propagation, a clustering
algorithm by passing messages between data points.
This program is optimized for sparse similarites, where there are O(n) finite
similarites and others are negative infinity similarites.
You can find the details about affinity propagation at the following URL:

 MAKE AND RUN
==============

First, prepare a similarity file like:

272
0 4 -0.866169620986
8 15 -5.54097758238
3 221 -0.391640594901
10 0 -5.89035174724
77 102 -0.205104158914
135 248 -1.00319562134
98 40 -0.992369707296
68 132 -1.97837136257
...

Input specification is following:
First line contains an integer standing for the size of the matrix.
Following lines each contain two integers and a real number standing for
the row index i, the column index j and the similarity s(i,j) respectively.
Note that i and j are 0-origin.
Input ends with an end-of-file.

Then, make and run. (sim.txt is a similarity file mentioned above)

$ make
$ ./ap < sim.txt
